# Proposal: Netflix suggestions app
## An app that suggests Netflix movies and tv shows for the user.
Jacob Wagner

## Needs and Opportunities
People need something to helo t hem find movies and tv shows so they don't have to waste time searching movies and following the highlights to see what to watch. They need something that will do it for them based on their personality.

## Audience / Clients / Users
The intended audience for this app are people who are new to Netflix and people who bored within there genre(s).

## Product
This product is an app in which users will take a test to determine their personality and find out which movies best suits them. I will show the class the app when the project is due. 

## Timeline

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| February 5    | Have the constructor and other base methods done  |
| February 12   | have the personality quiz started |
| February 19   | Have the comedy vs. drama aspect of the personality quiz done or close to done |
| March 11      | Have some of the selected movies in the database |
| April 1       | Have at least 1 or 2 genres in the code |
| April 29      | Have about half of the movies in |
| May 27        | Have the program working like a well-oiled machine |

## Reality Check
The things that are neccesary to my project is a Netflix subscription(which I already have) and a computer.

## Conclusion
Overall, this product will introduce users to new and exciting genres and broaden their list of watched movies. This product will git(get it?) people out of their Netflix ruts and allow them to achieve their dreams.
