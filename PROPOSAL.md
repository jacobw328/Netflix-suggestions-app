## An app that suggests Netflix movies and tv shows for the user.
Jacob Wagner

## Needs and Opportunities
People need something to helo t hem find movies and tv shows so they don't have to waste time searching movies and following the highlights to see what to watch. They need something that will do it for them based on their personality.

## Audience / Clients / Users
The intended audience for this app are people who are new to Netflix and people who bored within there genre(s).

## Product
This product is an app in which users will take a test to determine their personality and find out which movies best suits them. I will show the class the app when the project is due. 

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that's
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Deliverable 1 |
| April 1       | Deliverable 2 |
| April 29      | Deliverable 3 |

## Reality Check
I am looking for moonshots here, but even moonshots need budgets. What
equipment are you going to need? What other capital expenditures do you
anticipate, and how will you meet them?

## Conclusion
Wrap it up. Why are you fired up about this project? Inspire us to support you,
and give us a great reason to approve your project.
