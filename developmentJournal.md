#### Today I basically did the skeleton coding. I implemented a bunch of methods and started to work on my main method. I created integers called anime, action, comedy, drama, family, clasics, documentaries, horror, musicals, romance, sci-fi, sports, and thrillers.
These integers are the genres of movies that I am doing(if you couldn't tell). I created ints because when I implement my persoanlity quiz, for every question(I dont't know how many questions there will be yet) depending on your answer one or multiple ints will icrease by 1. By the end of the quiz, the program will rank the ints and combine the top 2 or 3 to select the movies and tv shoes of the genre made for you. In my main method I implemented a little bit of dialogue. When you start up the main method argument the program prints out a line that says "Hello, welcome to El Pato, a program designed to help you find what movies and tv shows best fit your personality on Netflix. What is your name?". Oh, the name is sunject to change, I was trying to make one and duck came to my head so I made it Spanish. After this line of text the program says "Hello " + name + ", if you would like to take a personality test type 'peronality test', or if you would like to exit, type 'exit'". And then if the user doesen't type 'exit" or "personality quiz" it says"Spry, I don't unserstand that command please try again".
