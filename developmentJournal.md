#### Today I basically did the skeleton coding. I implemented a bunch of methods and started to work on my main method. I created integers called anime, action, comedy, drama, family, clasics, documentaries, horror, musicals, romance, sci-fi, sports, and thrillers.
These integers are the genres of movies that I am doing(if you couldn't tell). I created ints because when I implement my persoanlity quiz, for every question(I dont't know how many questions there will be yet) depending on your answer one or multiple ints will icrease by 1. By the end of the quiz, the program will rank the ints and combine the top 2 or 3 to select the movies and tv shoes of the genre made for you. In my main method I implemented a little bit of dialogue.
