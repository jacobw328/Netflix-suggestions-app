#### Today I basically did the skeleton coding. I implemented a bunch of methods and started to work on my main method. I created integers called anime, action, comedy, drama, family, clasics, documentaries, horror, musicals, romance, sci-fi, sports, and thrillers.
These integers are the genres of movies that I am doing(if you couldn't tell). I created ints because when I implement my persoanlity quiz, for every question(I dont't know how many questions there will be yet) depending on your answer one or multiple ints will icrease by 1. By the end of the quiz, the program will rank the ints and combine the top 2 or 3 to select the movies and tv shoes of the genre made for you. In my main method I implemented a little bit of dialogue. When you start up the main method argument the program prints out a line that says "Hello, welcome to El Pato, a program designed to help you find what movies and tv shows best fit your personality on Netflix. What is your name?". Oh, the name is sunject to change, I was trying to make one and duck came to my head so I made it Spanish. After this line of text the program says "Hello " + name + ", if you would like to take a personality test type 'peronality test', or if you would like to exit, type 'exit'". And then if the user doesen't type 'exit" or "personality quiz" it says"Spry, I don't unserstand that command please try again".

####Today for my 20% project I googled and took a bunch of personality tests(like 3 or 4 I think) and I used tried to use some of their questions and implement another version of them into my program. 
But, they all sucked and so I spent time trying to create my own question. 
Oh, before that I made my main method and made it usable by the user so now you can exit and answer 2 questions. 
The questions are like "A girl gets dumped twice on her birthday by the same guy two years in a row. Is this funny or sad?" and "a horse trips while jumping over a hurdle and breaks a leg. Funny or Sad?"
I am just doing a funny vs. sad test right now.

####Today for my project I added some questions to my personality test regarding thr\e comedy versus drama section. I also debugged my program because it had a lot of bugs. The questions I added were "Do you like movies that are about crying, intense scenes, and scandals or movies that will have you laughing the whole time?" I also added a question about a guy who drop kicks a dog off a bridge for getting hit with a burrito(I stole it from Anchorman FYI). Another item I added was an int called screwUps which basically every time u\you screw up in your typing it goes up and when it reaches a certain value, it criticizes  you. Don't worry it's fun criticism. I believe I am on track for my first deliverable next friday I will probably work on it this weekend or next week.

####Today for my 20% project I worked on completing my deliverable 1. My deliverable is to have all or most of the comedy vs drama test done for my personality test. I got all of it done along with a little bit of side content. I have 5 questions that all compare comedy vs drama. I also fixed all of my bugs so far and added different features to questions. Like if you don't understand a reference that was made you can say “idk” and another question will appear. I also started on the horror vs action section of the quiz and I have 3 questions so far. After a section of the quiz, you will be prompted with a question that tells you your results and asks if you would like to change it. This still has a little bit of bugs but I will fix it.

####Today I worked on my action vs horror section of my quiz. I got all of my questions done and revised a few that were already complete. I mainly worked on bugs throughout my whole program(I had a lot) and stuff like that. I realized that my comparison of the two topics of the quiz was wrong where as I just compared one vs the oother and had no alternatives or tie breakers. So I implemented tie breakers, alternatives, and I revised my section where you can change tho outcome if the user isnt satisfied. Another thing I did was break up my main method into sections for cleanliness and more control. I also made my nonsense response a different method so I can reuse them.
