#### Today I basically did the skeleton coding. I implemented a bunch of methods and started to work on my main method. I created integers called anime, action, comedy, drama, family, clasics, documentaries, horror, musicals, romance, sci-fi, sports, and thrillers.
These integers are the genres of movies taht i am doing(if you couldn't tell).
